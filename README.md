Create a custom Map Leader key to make it easy to run your own commands. We'll make it easy to show and hide NERDtree with a simple shortcut. Add these two lines to your .vimrc file:

    let mapleader = ","  
    map <Leader>d :NERDTreeToggle<CR> :set number<CR>   

With that, you can open and close NERDTree with

    ,d

in Normal mode.
